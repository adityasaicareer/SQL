# SQL Notes: LIMIT and HAVING Clauses

This document provides a **comprehensive and detailed explanation** of two important SQL clauses — **LIMIT** and **HAVING**.  
Each section includes syntax, conceptual understanding, examples, and real-world use cases.  

---

## 🧭 1. LIMIT Clause

### 🔹 Definition
The **LIMIT** clause in SQL is used to specify the **number of records** to return from the result set.  
It is particularly useful when you only need a subset of data, such as the top 5, 10, or 100 records.

---

### 🔹 Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
LIMIT number;
```

or with an **offset** (to skip some rows before starting to return the results):

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
LIMIT offset, count;
```
or equivalently in some dialects:
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
LIMIT count OFFSET offset;
```

---

### 🔹 Explanation of Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| `number` or `count` | Specifies how many rows to return. |
| `offset` | Specifies how many rows to skip before starting to return results. |

---

### 🔹 Example 1: Retrieve Top 5 Students by Marks

```sql
SELECT name, marks
FROM students
ORDER BY marks DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

✅ This query returns the **top 5 students** with the highest marks.

---

### 🔹 Example 2: Pagination Example (Using OFFSET)

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM employees
ORDER BY emp_id
LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20;
```

✅ This query skips the first 20 rows and returns the **next 10 rows**, useful for paginated results in applications.

---

### 🔹 Real-World Use Cases

- Displaying limited search results (e.g., top 10 products).
- Implementing pagination in web applications.
- Sampling small portions of large datasets.
- Performance optimization when full data retrieval is unnecessary.

### 🔹 Code Snippet from File

```sql
-- Limit and Aliasing

SELECT * FROM employee_demographics LIMIT 5;

-- BY LIMIT WE CAN ACTUALLY RETRIVE THE TOP 3 OR TOP  5 CONDIDATES

SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE_SALARY ORDER BY SALARY DESC LIMIT 3,5;

-- THE ABVE LIMIT 3,5 REPRESENTA THE FIVE ROWS AFTER THE TOP 3 OUTPUT 

-- ALIASING

SELECT GENDER,AVG(AGE) AS AVERAGEAGE FROM employee_demographics GROUP BY GENDER HAVING AVERAGEAGE>40;

-- WE CAN ACTUALLY USE THE ALIAS NAME IN THE HAVING CLAUSE;

--JOINS,-- SUBQUERIES, --WINDOWFUNCTIONS
```

---

## 🧭 2. HAVING Clause

### 🔹 Definition
The **HAVING** clause is used to filter the results of **aggregate functions** (like COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN).  
It acts **after the GROUP BY** clause, allowing filtering of grouped data.  
It is similar to `WHERE`, but `WHERE` cannot be used with aggregate functions — that’s where `HAVING` comes in.

---

### 🔹 Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, aggregate_function(column2)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column1
HAVING condition;
```

---

### 🔹 Difference Between WHERE and HAVING

| Feature | WHERE | HAVING |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Applies on | Individual rows | Groups (after aggregation) |
| Used with aggregate functions | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Execution order | Before grouping | After grouping |

---

### 🔹 Example 1: Filter Groups Using SUM()

```sql
SELECT department, SUM(salary) AS total_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING SUM(salary) > 50000;
```

✅ This query retrieves departments where the **total salary exceeds 50,000**.

---

### 🔹 Example 2: Using COUNT()

```sql
SELECT city, COUNT(customer_id) AS total_customers
FROM customers
GROUP BY city
HAVING COUNT(customer_id) > 5;
```

✅ Returns only those cities that have **more than 5 customers**.

---

### 🔹 Example 3: Combining WHERE and HAVING

```sql
SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
WHERE job_title = 'Engineer'
GROUP BY department
HAVING AVG(salary) > 70000;
```

✅ Filters engineers first using `WHERE`, then filters groups based on their average salary using `HAVING`.

---

### 🔹 Real-World Use Cases

- Identifying high-performing departments (e.g., with high average revenue).
- Filtering aggregated reports (e.g., regions with total sales above threshold).
- Analytics and dashboards that summarize grouped metrics.

---

### 🔹 Code Snippet from File

```sql
select gender,avg(age)
from employee_demographics
group by gender
having avg(age)>40;

--  group by function whicj was used to get the occupation of more sal
SELECT OCCUPATION,AVG(SALARY) 
FROM EMPLOYEE_SALARY
WHERE OCCUMATION LIKE "%MANAGER%"
GROUP BY OCCUPATION
HAVING AVG(SALARY)>50000
```

---

## 📘 Summary Table

| Clause | Used With | Filters On | Works With Aggregates | Example |
|---------|------------|-------------|------------------------|----------|
| LIMIT | SELECT | Number of rows | ❌ No | `LIMIT 10` |
| HAVING | GROUP BY | Aggregated groups | ✅ Yes | `HAVING SUM(price) > 1000` |

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Always combine LIMIT with ORDER BY** to ensure deterministic results.  
2. **HAVING** should follow **GROUP BY**, but you can use it without `GROUP BY` if you want to filter on an aggregate applied to the entire result.  
3. In PostgreSQL and MySQL, `LIMIT` is evaluated *after* all filtering and sorting steps are complete.  
4. `OFFSET` can be inefficient for large datasets — prefer keyset pagination (using `WHERE id > last_seen_id`) for scalability.
